# Project Rules

## NEVER send Pull Requests to the upstream repository (Aratako/MioTTS-Inference)

This is a personal fork. All changes must stay in this fork (kazuph/MioTTS-Inference).
Do NOT create PRs against the upstream repository under any circumstances.

- `origin` = `kazuph/MioTTS-Inference` (push here)
- `upstream` = `Aratako/MioTTS-Inference` (read-only, for syncing)
